"!Save Yourself!" Astronaut edition:

This program is a game where we have an astronaut who has to collect hearts in space in 10 seconds. 
Using the backspace button (SELECT) and then enter button (START) on your PC keyboard, you can navigate through the game.
Use the arrows keys to move around, and make sure you completely "eat" the heart by covering it completely 
in order to reap its benefits!!
